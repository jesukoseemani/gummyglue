##Introduction <br/><br/>
 A personal music web app for my girlfriend (GLUE) and me (GUMMY) which we also share across to close friends and family.<br/><br/>
 It consists of Fifty (50) best songs and updating it every Sunday evening.<br/><br/>
 This was my first app with React using create-react-app. I use all the advantages of react hook from useRef, useEffect, useState. The data is manually created from a free music website. I worked with framer-motion which is a production-ready animation Library for React.<br/><br/>
 This part has helped me with understanding the concept of asynchronous Javascript.
